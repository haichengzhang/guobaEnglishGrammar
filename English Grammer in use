unit 1:现在进行时（I am doing)

A:
	请看下面的例句：
	Sarah is in her car.She is on her way to work.She is drving to work.
	在说话时，她正在驾车行驶。驾驶的动作还没有完成。
	am/is/are + -ing是现在进行时的构成形式：
		I am 			(= I'm)			driving
		he/she/it is 	(= he's等）		working
		we/you/they are (= we're等)		doing 等
		
B:
	I am doing something表示”我正在做某事；我已开始做某事，但尚未完成“。通常在说话时动作仍在进行：
		Please don't make so much noise.I'm trying to work.(而不用I try)
		'Where's Mark?'		'He's having a shower.'(而不用He has shower)
		Let's go out now.It's raining any more.(而不用It doesn't rain)
		(at a party)Hi,Jane.Are you enjoying the party?(而不用Do you enjoy)
		What's all that noise? 	What's going on?(=What's happening?)
		
	但有时在说话的当下，动作并不是正在进行，例如：
	Steve is talking to a friend on the phone.He says:
		I'm reading a really good book at the moment.It's about a man who ...
		在说话时，汤姆并不是在读书。他的意思是这本书已经开始读了，但还没有读完。
		
	再看一些例子：
		Kate wants to work in Italy,so she's learning Italian.(但是在说话的当时她可能并没有在学意大利语)
		Some friends of mine are building their house.They hope to finish it next summer.
		
C:
	现在进行时可以与today/this week/this year等连用，表示现在这一阶段正在发生的动作或行为。
		A:You're working  hard today.(而不用You work hard today)	你今天工作很努力
		B:Yes,I have a lot to do.
		The company I work for isn't doing so well this year.

D:
	现在进行时通常与下列动词连用，表示现在一段时间内正在发生的变化：
	get change become increase rise fall grow improve begin start
	Is your English getting better? (而不用Does your English get better)	你的英语越来越好了吗？ 
	The population of the world is increasing very fast.(而不用increases)	世界人口增长很快。

Unit 2: 一般现在时(I do)
A:
	请看下列例句：
	Alex is a bus driver,but now he is in bed asleep.
	因此：He is not driving bus.(He is asleep)
	但是：He dirves a bus.(He is a bus driver)
	
	drive(s)/work(s)/do(es)等是一般现在时的构成形式
	I/we/you/they	 drive/work/do等
	he/she/it 		 drives/works/does等
		
		
B:
	一般现在时用来谈论现时的情况或状态，它用来表示一直发生的动作或行为，或是重复发送的动作或行为，或普遍的真理，而动作
	是否发生在说话的当时并不重要：
	Nurses look afer patients in hospitals.
	I usually go away at weekends.	我通常在周末外出。 
	The earth goes round the sun.
	Teh cafe opens at 7.30 in the morning.	咖啡店早上7.30点开门。 
	
	注意：he/she/it作主语时，动词要用单三。

	
C:
	我们用do/does来构成一般现在时的疑问句和否定句：
		do		I/we/you/they	work?		I/we/you/they 	don't 		work
		does	he/she/it		do?			he/she/it		doesn't 	do
		
		I come from Canada.Where do you come from?
		I don't go away very often.

		Julie doesn't drink tea very often.
		Robert usually goes away two or three times a year.
		
E:
	I promise/apologise等	apologise：道歉;
	有些行为是靠说话完成的。如作出的许诺，可以说I promise ...;提建议，可以说I suggest ...
	在这类句子中使用一般现在时：
		I promise I wont't be late.(而不用I'm promising)
		'What do you suggest I do?'	'I suggest that you ...'
	同样也可以说：I/apologise | advise | insist | agree | refuse ...等		insist：坚持; 强调; 坚决要求; 坚决认为;
